# SQL-Practice
The project purpose is to gain insights into league performance across seasons and countries. <br>
• Identity which countries or leagues are more competitive or high-scoring.<br>
• To visualize the football evaluation across countries.<br>
This is my learing practice of SQL. The live project can be seen on Kaggle workspace : https://www.kaggle.com/code/myatsukhai/sql-practices
